# Hand_Gesture_Volume_Control
This project introduces a hand gesture-based system for controlling the volume of a Windows system. By leveraging hand tracking technology, the system dynamically adjusts the audio volume based on the distance between the index finger and thumb. It offers a touchless and intuitive way to manage audio settings, showcasing the seamless integration of computer vision and human interaction.  

The implementation is built using Python and several powerful libraries. OpenCV is utilized for real-time image processing, while Mediapipe facilitates accurate hand tracking and landmark detection. Additionally, NumPy is employed for efficient mathematical computations. The project's highlight is the use of the pycaw library, developed by André Miras (https://github.com/AndreMiras), which simplifies interaction with the Windows Core Audio API. Special thanks to André Miras for making this crucial functionality accessible through his library.
